# Roth Touchline

Control floor heating thermostats from Roth.
To use this app you should have one controller, if you have more than one physical controller they have to be linked through roth beforehand.

After installing, visit app settings and enter the controller IP, then you should be able to add your devices (thermostats).

## Supported parameters:
The app supports:
* Renaming thermostats
* Set target temperature
* Select modes


This app supports the different modes provided by touchline. There are 3 modes and 3 week programs, but they are all interpreted as modes as in the default roth android app.

* Comfort
* Night
* Holiday (Off)

* Pro I
* Pro II
* Pro III
